While covid-19 has had a negative impact on the events industry, event planners have shown great resilience and adaptibility in finding ways to host events in a post covid world. 
Since events can prove to be major potential vectors for transmission of the virus, it is important to have systems in place to prevent overcrowding at these events & restrict unauthorized entry 

# ConnectNext

ConnectNext is a one stop event management platform for organizers & atendees in a world post covid.
Organizers can create one or multiple events on the platform.
Atendees on the other hand can view all the events near them & register for them.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Oranizers can "create an event" on the ConnectNext platform. Atendees can then register for events of their interest.
Organizers can set a "venue capacity" to restrict the form responses & prevent overcrowding.
Once an antendee registers for an event, they are sent a confirmation mail & a QR Code which is required for entry to the venue. Atendees are prompted to carry a valid ID
The QR code has the individuals name & details encoded in it & can be read using any basic QR code scanner.
This simple method can be used to verify people at the time of entry & prevent unauthorized entry.

Advantages of the platform:
* Prevent overcrowding / crowd-control
* Prevents unauthorized entry
* Organizers can easily create multiple events
